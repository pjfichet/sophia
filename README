Sophia
======

Sophia maintains an sqlite database of texts: it allows to
insert, modify and search information from the database.
Made to write my philosophy thesis, sophia has two aims:
comparing texts, and producing precises references.

Its companion, philia, will insert references from a sophia
database in a troff document.

While I used these tools to write my thesis, I am not using
them anymore: they are not maintained, and my knowledge
about them has diminished.
